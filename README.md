## What's Inside?

The backbone of our project! HTML provides the structure for our Emoji Elegance Parade. It's where we define the elements that make up the enchanting dance floor for our emojis.

2. CSS(F.css):
Meet the stylist! CSS adds the vibrant colors and stylish flair to our parade. It's responsible for creating a visually stunning backdrop, making the emojis pop with elegance.

3. JavaScript(F.js):
The conductor of our emoji orchestra! JavaScript (F.js) orchestrates the entire show. It controls the animation, ensures smooth movement, and adds that extra touch of interactivity to make your experience truly delightful.
